			<p>GitHub has proven to be a very useful system to collaborate and function with code, both in a personal and professional setting. No matter what, however, understanding how to use GitHub is an important part of life for technical based persons. As a political science major, I never used GitHub aside from casual browsing, but am creating this html file to show how easy it is to learn, and help others who might struggle.</a></p>

						<span id='personalinfo' style = 'position:relative; left:15px;'>The first step to submitting a pull request on GitHub is to fork the project, to create a copy in your own repository. While making edits to existing files, ensure that you provide proper version history, to ensure that others know what you changed in your commits. Once you've finished your changes and made your commit, you should see a notification that you are one branch ahead of the master, meaning that you have changes that the original one does not. To fix this, click the new pull request button, and after doing so, make sure your request has good notations on what you've changed, so that the person in charge of the original repository will accept your pull request. Make sure you leave a good description, especially in professional settings, because proper documentation will allow you to track back changes that might prove detrimental.</span>
